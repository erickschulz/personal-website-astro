        <h2>Research</h2>
       
    <p>Aside from ongoing collaboration with Ralf Hiptmair at ETH Zurich, my main area of research in the past couple years has been solvers for <strong>differential
           algebraic equations (DAEs)</strong>, as they arise from circuit models and more generally multi-physics systems.
<br><br> Building robust <strong>simulation software</strong> for power electronics is challenging, because the high-frequency switching of power semiconductors lead to transients
           that are extreme for double-precision floating-point arithmetic and system-level models cause multi-scale dynamics.
PLECS has established itself as the leading simulation 
           software in the field of power electronics.
It has done so by promoting ideal switch models. Despite discontinuities being, as one could say, the worst form of nonlinearity, PLECS cleverly rely on its consequences
           to perform very robust state-space simulation.
High-order integration and avoiding parasitic effects lead to much faster system-level simulations than what would be possible
           with a typical SPICE-like circuit solver.
<br><br> However, it is true that parasitic effects during switching may also be relevant to design engineers.
This is why our team has been developing a <strong>new 
           mixed-formulation mixed-signal multi-physics DAE solver</strong> that integrates the best of both worlds.
Within the elegant UI of PLECS, 
           users will be able to run different simulation types without having to reproduce their 
           complex schematics in another tool, greatly easing their workflow.
In order to acheive this, our team has developed new algorithms and modernized the established technology
           with contemporary numerical methods that were not previously used in the context of circuit simulation.
<br><br> I am glad to say that our team has also contributed to the numerical method used in the Nanostep solver, 
         which allows nano-seconds stepsize for real-time simulation of some important circuit topologies on the RT-box (our FPGA platform).

        <h2>Product Development</h2>
          <p>Over the past 
years, my most significant project has been developing a new type of <strong>SPICE circuits solver</strong> as part of Plexim's contribution to PowerizeD, a large consortium project 
              partially funded by Horizon Europe (for research and innovation).
Everything, 
              from the <strong>simulation engine to the architecture, the parser, the UI integration and more</strong>, has been written from scratch and re-invented by a team of
              talented scientists and software engineers.
The new product redefines state-of-the-art and enables a type of transient analysis simulation (of mixed-signal circuits
              and power-electronic systems) that hasn't been previously possible with existing solutions.
</p>
          <p>
              During my early days at Plexim, I worked on thermal modeling, particularly on <strong>surrogate models</strong> for thermal paths in semicondutors.
Since then, I have been periodically asked to <strong>fit</strong>, or re-fit with better model identification, thermal networks to impedance data.
So I recently made a simple Python package that application engineers can use to proceed with their thermal networks alchemy.
</p>
          <p>
              Another side project that I have been enjoying a lot recently is the implementation of a native feature in the software PLECS that works
              like Telescope in Neovim, Projectile in Emacs, or Spotlight and Raycast on macOS, for engineers to supercharge their workflow without having to be superusers.
It allows them
              to quickly <strong>fuzzy-search</strong> from anywhere their .plecs model files, launch commands and open tools such as the documentation and integrated console all within one search bar, greatly
              increasing discoverability of the software's feature.

        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>The foundational knowledge about numerical methods
   
        for PDEs of recent CSE graduates of ETH Zurich often comes from a dense mandatory course which my colleague Oliver Rietmann and 
              I contributed in building with Prof. Ralf Hiptmair during our years at ETH.
At the time, we managed and worked with a team of student
              developers to build a collection of ~65 simulation and optimization algorithms ranging from thermal phenomena, conservation laws, waves,
              electrostatics, force calculations, error estimators, convergence analysis and more.
As of today, development was moved to
              an internal gitlab repository.
<br><br>To see an older (unfortunatly stale) version, follow the link below. Stay tuned for (possibly) an upcoming re-release.
Starting from 2026, I will be replacing Ralf in teaching the course as a <strong>lecturer at ETH Zurich</strong>.</p>

              I love to learn, whether it's about new math, new science or new software technology.
             Thinking about how to improve power-electronics engineers' toolkit made me revisit my own software development tools.
I wondered how I could improve my workflow, and how the tools I enjoyed could in turn 
              help the engineers choosing our software (see for e.g. the fuzzy-search feature mentioned under Product Development).
                    <br><br> A few months ago, this lead me to neovim, tmux and a few other tools that I am still currently having fun exploring.
                    I find that it helps to have a consistent development experience across different operating systems 
                    (Windows at home, MacOS at the office, Linux at ETH). 
                    This hobby aligned nicely with my goal to discover the new LLM-assisted coding tools that are all the rage these days.
                    It is useful to better understand how far they can go, to know what they are best used for, and to know their limitations. 
                    AI has made writing configuration files for personal tools faster and made it easier for busy professionals to express
              their creativity through their own personalized setups.
